*   UML
    *   Unified Modelling Language
    *   General-purpose visual modeling language
    *   System modelling, complex or simple
    *   Specify, visualize, construct and document
    *   Inform stakeholders
    *   Understand, design, browse, configure, maintain and control information about systems
    *   No standard process but is intended to be useful with iterative development processes
    *   Not a programming language, but can be used to write programs
    *   Not a detailed development process
    *   Designed to simplify and consolidate the different object-oriented development methods and unify concepts
    *   Not enforced
    *   Accepted concepts from object-oriented methods
    *   Intended to model most application domains
    *   Benefits
        *   Quick understanding
        *   Simplify complex systems
        *   Communicate design decision
        *   Independent of technology used
        *   System handover
    *   Two kinds, structural and behavior
    *   Decision tree
    *   Different diagrams allows modelling a system from separate, but related viewpoints
    *   Some structural UML diagram types
        *   Class
        *   Object
        *   Package
        *   Component
        *   Composite structure
        *   Deployment
        *   Profile diagrams
    *   Some behavioral UML diagram
        *   Use-case
        *   Activity
        *   Sequence
        *   State
        *   Communication
        *   Interaction overview
        *   Timing
    *   More than visual notation, can be used to generate code and test cases
*   Complexity of UML
    *   A tool you can use, but not have to use. Important, but not critical
    *   Product of consensus
    *   Not as clean and coherent as a product of a single will
    *   Has some superfluous features
    *   Has overlapping features that are not always well integrated.
    *   Was meant from business modelling to graphical programming
    *   Tension between concepts of conceptual modeling and programming language representation
    *   You don't need to know or use every feature of UML
    *   Unnecessary to listen too much to UML language lawyers, there is no single right way
*   OO Analysis and Design
    *   Identify objects
    *   Define relationships
    *   Establish Interface
    *   Making design executable
