*   Interface class
    *   Classes that implements interfaces
    *   Has “<<interface>>” before the name
    *   Data hiding behind methods
    *   Can only contain method declaration
    *   All the methods must be implemented in classes that extends the interface
    *   For a class A to use interface B, connect with a dotted line
*   Abstract class
    *   Cannot be instantiated by itself
    *   You can hide data
    *   Italic for name
    *   Either partially implemented or not implemented at all
    *   Let's subclasses to implement (virtual) or override
*   Enumeration
    *   <<enumeration>>
    *   Name
    *   States
    *   User defined data types
    *   Named idents that represent values of the enumeration (states)
*   Data types
    *   <<dataType>>
    *   Structure holding fields/data members
*   As a system grows you need to worry more about controlling dependencies.
    *   The more out of control it is the bigger the ripple is, making it harder to change anything.
*   The simpler the better
