## What is object oriented programming?

A way to model and organize your code into classes, often with polymorphism and inheritence.

Often more scalable

## What are the basic concepts of OOP?

- A class often has methods and fields (data) defined, these are used to objects that actually contains the data with the methods defined in the class.
- Adding methods to data instead of running functions to data

## What are the main principles of OOP?

Four main principles of OOP:

- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Polymorphism
- Inheritence

- Bundling / Data hiding
    - Data members / attributes / fields
- Types
    - Visibility (public, private, protected)

**Reasons**
- Security
- Data hiding
- Simplicity
- Aesthetics
